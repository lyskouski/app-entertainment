# Initiate the project

Kotlin Multiplatform is a feature of Kotlin that allows to share code between different platforms, such as Android, iOS, 
web, desktop, and more. To create a demo project for Kotlin Multiplatform, we can follow these steps:

- Download and install the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio with the latest Kotlin plugin.
- Clone the project template by selecting File | New | Project from Version Control in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Open the build.gradle.kts file, the build script that contains the project settings.
- Choose the platforms and targets you want to support in your project. You can use the Kotlin Multiplatform wizard to help you with this step.
- Write your shared code in the commonMain source set and your platform-specific code in the corresponding source sets, such as androidMain, iosMain, etc.
- Add dependencies to your project using the kotlin { sourceSets { â€¦ } } DSL. You can use standard, test, or kotlinx libraries, as well as third-party libraries.
- Run, test, and debug your project using the IDE tools or the command line.
