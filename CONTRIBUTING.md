# Contributing to Zabauka (app-entertainment)

Any help is always welcome!

There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping to 
triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, or helping out in any other way.

## Quality Assurance

Creating tests are really valuable contributions to open source projects. But preserve a common sense by adding a new
scope. They should not be written for the coverage purposes. Tests should verify the business logic and protect 
developers from mistakes.

## Development

As a note, the application is written on `Kotlin` language by using `Kotlin Multiplatform` framework. In case it's a 
new technology for you, check my book: [From Zero to Market with KMP](./docs/implementation-flow/README.md).

A clean code, covered by automated tests, is the best that can be done and greatly appreciated.

The only convention that we're following described on our 
[Wiki Page](https://github.com/lyskouski/app-finance/wiki/Project-Notation)
regarding commits notation.

Grand Rules:
- raised issue as a precondition to start work (named commits)
- split changes to a logical chunks (avoid big bang changes)
- write automated tests (neglect manual QA)


## Localization

Native speakers (and translators) are welcomed to improve our translations since most of them are done by a "foreigner"
with an assistance of automation tools ([DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator), [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/), 
and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)). 

Check [Localization Details](./lib/README.md).

## Outreach

Writing posts about the project in any social networks is a key factor to keeping it alive and being in demand.

## Releases

Writing release notes and blog posts, creating supporting materials (video, documentation) is respected.
